# IPL-Match-analysis
## Project Objective
To understand how batting strategies shift across different phases of the match.
To evaluate bowler effectiveness and pressure-building moments.
To explore run-scoring patterns and wicket distributions.
To visualize how match momentum changes through run rate dynamics.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/puvvaditeja/IPL-Match-analysis/blob/main/ipl_match_deliveries.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions
- Strike Rate of Batters in Match Phases (Powerplay, Middle, Death)
- Team-wise Batting intent across Match Phases
- Wicket Type Distribution
- Extras Type Distribution
- Run Distribution (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s) per Team
- Boundary % vs Dot Ball % per Batter
- Bowler Economy Rate Analysis
- Team-wise Batting Runs by Phase
- Over-by-Over Run Comparison
- Required Run Rate after Each Over

## Project Insights
- T Stubbs and KL Rahul showcased aggressive intent in the Death Overs
- PD Salt and AR Patel were strong starters with strike rates over 140 in the Powerplay.
- Delhi Capitals showed a clear surge in aggression during the Death Overs, registering a strike rate close to 240
- The most common dismissal types are caught followed by caught behind
- DC team with fewer dot balls and more singles demonstrates tactical batting and efficient strike rotation.
- PD Salt stands out with the most balanced approach: high boundary rate (~39%) and relatively low dot ball %; indicating consistent attacking intent.
- 15th over is the turning point over for the DC

## Conclusion
- This analysis reveals how different phases of a T20 match influence both batting aggression and bowling strategies. Bowlers who maintained tight economy in middle and death overs proved key, while batters' strike rates shifted based on match pressure. The required run rate chart clearly shows turning points, helping to identify when the match tilted in favor of a team. These insights provide valuable perspectives for analysts, coaches, and fans alike.
